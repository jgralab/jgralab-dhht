	 * 
	 * If the tracked object is an Incidence, this Buffer holds six values of type
	 * long and its size is 48 Bytes. If the tracked object is a GraphElement, it holds
	 * seven values of type long and one value of type int, which means its size 
	 * is 60 Bytes.
	 * 
	 * Every index in the buffer is reserved for a specific attribute.
	 * 
	 * For an Incidence, the indexes are:
	 *  0 - incidenceClassId
	 *  4 - nextIncidenceIdAtEdge
	 * 12 - nextIncidenceIdAtVertex
	 * 20 - previousIncidenceIdAtEdge
	 * 28 - previousIncidenceIdAtVertex
	 * 36 - incidentEdgeId
	 * 44 - incidentVertexId
	 * 
	 * For a GraphElement, the indexes are:
	 *  0 - nextElementId
	 *  8 - previousElementId
	 * 16 - firstIncidenceId
	 * 24 - lastIncidenceId
	 * 32 - incidenceListVersion
	 * 40 - SigmaId
	 * 48 - subOrdianteGraphId
	 * 56 - kappa
