 * to write the contents of a ByteBuffer into this file, or to read a number of 
 * bytes from this file, which are then returned in a byte buffer.
 * 
 * Internally, it uses a MappedByteBuffer for increased efficiency if the operating
 * system isn't Windows. If Windows is used, it sticks with a FileChannel because a
 * bug in Java makes it impossible for files to be deleted if it has been 
 * accessed via a MappedByteBuffer at any point.
